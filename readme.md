# Diskover Index Dashboard

Diskover Index Dashboard is an interactive Streamlit application for visualizing and reporting on file storage metrics across multiple indexes. Upload a CSV export from Diskover and explore your data in a dark-themed dashboard, complete with charts and PDF reporting.

## Features

- **Unit toggle**: Switch between GB, TB, and PB for all size metrics.
- **Extensions summary**:
  - Bar chart of the top 20 file extensions by total size.
  - Pie chart of file extensions by count.
- **Hot/Warm/Cold summary**:
  - Bar charts comparing size and count across storage tiers (Hot, Warm, Cold) for both MTime and ATime fields.
- **Largest files table**: Interactive table listing the top 50 largest files, with columns for file name, extension, size, and last modified timestamp (in your local timezone).

## CSV Format

Your CSV file must contain the following columns:

- `Index`: Name of the index.
- `Type`: Row type, e.g., "Top Extension", "Largest File", "Hot Summary", etc.
- `Key`: The key or identifier (e.g., extension name or file name).
- `Count`: Number of occurrences.
- `Size (Bytes)`: Total size in bytes.
- `MTime`: Last modification timestamp (ISO format).
- `ATime`: Last access timestamp (ISO format).

Ensure that summary rows for Hot/Warm/Cold use `Type` values containing "Summary".

## Customization

- **Styling**: Modify the CSS block at the top of the script to change colors or fonts.
- **Page settings**: Adjust `st.set_page_config` parameters for page title, layout, and icon.
- **Logo**: Replace `Diskover_Banner.png` with your own image; update the `Image.open` path if needed.
